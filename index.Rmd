# Kevin (Lingfeng) Li

**Hello!**

I am a student at the London School of Economics, studying for a MSc in Political Science & Political Economy. I am interested in using quantitative methods in my research, particularly statistical methods and new advances in statistical learning. I also have an interest in Game Theory.

I completed my BSc in Politics at King's College London, receiving a First Class Honours result (US equivalent: 3.8-4.0 GPA or Summa Cum Laude). During my degree, I also took summer courses in Data Science and Machine Learning at the London School of Economics during my undergraduate studies. Now, I am now a postgraduate student at the London School of Economics, studying for a MSc in Political Science & Political Economy.

This is my personal website. I don't really have a purpose for this site, besides using it to post some of my accomplishments or what I find interesting!
